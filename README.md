ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,

this my first larger app built in Node.js/Express.

It's hosted on Heroku and LIVE ðŸš€ 

Go see it here https://preschoolfinder.net

It uses several third-party APIs such as:

- Cloudinary | for image hosting
- MapBox | for Geocoding and address autocomplete
- Mongo DB | for database
- Postmark | for transactional emails (new account, password recovery, etc...)

Since the app functionality is tightly dependent on these APIs, it's not possible to just Clone and run a fully functional app without providing credentials for each in the config/config.env file.

And due to security concerns (and my wallet, lol) I can't share these credentials publicly.

So this code is mainly for a preview purposes.
